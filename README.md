## Next setup your theme in theme/theme.js

### Styled Components ###
The following components will be needed for our app from MUI:

App Bar with Search Field
https://mui.com/components/app-bar/#app-bar-with-search-field

Paper
https://mui.com/components/paper

And more info on Typography:
https://mui.com/components/typography/

## Next setup your API call in api/key.js and youtube.js ##
You will need to get a key from youtube at the following link:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

You will place your key in a .env file placed in the app's root directory.
React App will automatically load the key from the .env file. So long as you name it REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY, it will be loaded.

## You MUST add your .env file to your .gitignore file, otherwise your key will be public. ##
